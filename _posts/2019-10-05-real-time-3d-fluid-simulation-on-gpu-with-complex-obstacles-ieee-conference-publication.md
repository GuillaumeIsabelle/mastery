> Abstract: In this paper, we solve the 3D fluid dynamics problem in a complex environment by taking advantage of the parallelism and programmability of GPU. In difference from other methods, innovation is made in two aspects. Firstly, more general boundary conditions could be processed on GPU in our method. By the method, we generate the boundary from a 3D scene with solid clipping, making the computation run on GPU despite of the complexity of the whole geometry scene. Then by grouping the voxels into diffe Source: *[Real-time 3D fluid simulation on GPU with complex obstacles - IEEE Conference Publication][1]*
